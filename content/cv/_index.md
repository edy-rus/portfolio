## Profile

Technical Consultant with over two years of hands-on experience delivering full-stack solutions, scripting, infrastructure automation, and customer-facing engagements at InfinityIT, a managed service provider. I have designed, built, deployed, and supported production-grade systems across Windows environments, built internal tooling, implemented AI and automation pipelines, and acted as both a systems architect and public-facing representative.  

I value clarity, low-complexity solutions, and maintain a strong bias toward clean design and measurable outcomes. I am currently seeking to apply my practical experience and engineering mindset toward building intelligent, agent-powered systems that improve real-world workflows.

## Experience

### InfinityIT — Technical Consultant  
**2023 – Present**  
Gisborne, New Zealand  

As the technical lead in a small, high-ownership environment, I am responsible for the full lifecycle of internal and client-facing systems. My work involves scripting automation, application development, and direct client support, as well as representing the company in business and networking groups. Highlights:

- Designed and built a Windows desktop overlay tool for customer endpoint branding using Go and Windows API. Reduced memory usage by 96%, removed all dependencies, and simplified deployment to a single executable and registry key.  
- Refactored deployment workflows using PowerShell for better error handling, maintainability, and observability within Datto RMM.
- Built a fully automated, brand-aligned blog publishing pipeline using n8n, GPT-4o Mini, DALL·E 2, and the WordPress API, reducing post cost by over 90% while maintaining editorial quality.
- Developed websites, handled graphic design and branding assets, and supported customer-facing web infrastructure.  
- Act as the primary representative for the Gisborne branch at BNI and Chamber of Commerce events, leading technical communication, networking, and community engagement on behalf of the company.
